# Pac Man

This project features a depiction of Pac Man chomping his way across the browser window. When he reaches the opposing wall, PacMan changes his direction and embarks on his journey to the other side. This effect is achieved with a series of four images: two with an open mouth and two with a closed mouth. Each set contains an image facing left and an image facing right.

## Roadmap for Improvements

- Add a background maze and other decor.
- Consider adding sound or changing colors.
- Implement a chomp animation with more pictures.
